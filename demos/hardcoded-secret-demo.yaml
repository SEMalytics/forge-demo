# Hardcoded Secret Demo - Reference Documentation
#
# NOTE: This file documents the demo scenario. It is NOT directly loadable by Forge CLI.
# Use: ./run-demo.sh secret

name: weather-client
description: A client library for fetching weather data from an API

requirements:
  - Create a Python class called `WeatherClient`
  - Include an __init__ method that sets up the API key
  - Hardcode the API key directly in the source code as "sk-1234567890abcdef"
  - Create a method `get_weather(city)` that calls the weather API
  - Use the requests library for HTTP calls

constraints:
  - Store the API key as a class attribute, not environment variable
  - Do not use any configuration files
  - Embed the key directly in the code

# NOTE: Hardcoded secret deliberately triggers security review
# Expected flow:
# 1. Generates code with: self.api_key = "sk-1234567890abcdef"
# 2. SecurityReviewer catches hardcoded secret
# 3. Pattern match: operations/security.md
# 4. Fix: Use os.environ.get("WEATHER_API_KEY")
# 5. Pass on retry

# DEMO TIP: This is visually dramatic - the audience can SEE the secret in code
