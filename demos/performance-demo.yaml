name: duplicate-finder
description: Find duplicate items in a list

requirements:
  - Create a Python function called `find_duplicates`
  - Accept a list of items
  - Return a list of items that appear more than once
  - Use nested loops to compare each item with every other item
  - Do NOT use sets or dictionaries for optimization

constraints:
  - Must use O(n²) nested loop approach
  - Do not use collections.Counter
  - Do not use set() for deduplication
  - Compare each pair with a double for loop

# NOTE: O(n²) when O(n) is possible with a set
# Expected flow:
# 1. Generates nested for loops checking item == other_item
# 2. PerformanceReviewer catches O(n²) complexity
# 3. Pattern match: core/architecture.md or operations/implementation.md
# 4. Fix: Use set or dict for O(n) solution
# 5. Pass on retry

# DEMO TIP: Good for showing the PerformanceReviewer agent specifically
